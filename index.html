      <img id="totoro" src="Coding/me8.jpeg" alt="This is my picture! I'm wearing a white shirt, pearl necklace, peark earrings, and I'm holding up a peace sign (my default pose in every picture!). I have brown eyes and brown hair." width="500" height="500">
      <p> I started learning how to code just last school year with the goal of pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science. I  discovered more about coding when I took my first online computer science course, which was the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program, where I learned about the world of game development. However, I realized my interests were elsewhere in web development. Now, I’m excited to expand my current skills to build and design websites. Currently, I’m taking AP Computer science and will be taking Computer Science Foundations after Christmas.<p> When I’m not coding, I’m in school taking part in several clubs such as Mu Alpha Theta, where I serve as the historian and a member of the tutoring committee to help organize tutoring sessions. Along with that, I’m also involved in Key Club, BETA, and DECA where I work with other students to volunteer in my community and develop communication and leadership skills. Throughout high school I have maintained a 3.9 GPA with the inclusion of a few rigorous classes such as AP Human Geography, AP Seminar, AP United States History, AP Computer Science, and AP Language. I look forward to pushing myself to greater heights as a student, developer, and member of my community. Thank you for joining me on my journey!  </p>
