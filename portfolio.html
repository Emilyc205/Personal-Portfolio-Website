      <p>This was my first game development project I did using Replit. I was given the choice to create a CYOA (Choose Your Own Adventure). I decided to center my  story around a young girl who dreams of becoming a engineer, pushing through the obstacles that come her way. Though I was unable to complete the game because of the time constraint, it was a great way for me to learn more about game development! </p>
